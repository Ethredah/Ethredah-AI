<br/>

### QUICK START
To use this chatbot, download the zipped file of the repository and import it in a new agent on your DialogFlow Console.

## Okay then...let's get started:

* Go to DialogFlow Console
 Create a new Agent 



 * Create An Intent

  Create an Intent _This one is about hobbies_  where you ask the bot what her hobbies are :)

   ![Hobbies Intent](intent.png "Hobbies Intent")





  * Enable Speech

   To enable the bot talk back to users enable speech under settings and choose the desired output encoding.

   *Create More Intents of your choice and train the agent with enough data to answer queries efficiently*
